# ChipsGame

## Program built for educational purposes
I have built this game during my involvement in the Engineers and Geoscientists BC Science Alive progam, 
to encourage and interest prospective minds about coding. The goal of this game is to pick a certain number of chips
so that you are not with the last chip, you can play against an AI or with another peer.
